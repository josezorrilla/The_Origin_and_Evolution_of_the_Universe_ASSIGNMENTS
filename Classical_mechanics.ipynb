    "\n",
    "These are the simplifying hypothesis we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ball's dimensions and geometry are not relevant for the problem (it is very small compared to the distance travelled): we will consider it to be a point particle with mass $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Earth is flat (we are not launching a rocket with a range comparable to its radius). We will also consider that the force of gravity is constant, with its acceleration equal to $g=9.81\\,\\rm m \\, s^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is no atmosphere, so we will not consider the effect of air resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The ball is initially launched with a velocity $v_0$ at an angle $\\theta$ from the horizontal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, the motion of the ball is determined by Newton's second law of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up a coordinate system, with the $x$ axis parallel to the ground and pointing towards the initial velocity of the ball, and the $y$ axis perpendicular to the ground pointing upwards. The $z$ axis is set so that $\\{x,y,z\\}$ is a right-handed coordinate system. The components of the equations of motion are then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_x = 0 \\\\ a_y = -g \\\\ a_z = 0$$\n",

    "From which we can compute the distance traveled by the time the ball hits the ground. \n",

    "  a. This system of equations has an analytic solution. We will compute it and use it to solve the problem.\n",
